# GB Interceptor Case

These are the design files for the 3d printed case for the GB Interceptor. See the build guide in the main Readme for details.

# Important note about the break-out extension board

If you want to create a custom case using the extension board to place the cartridge slot in a more flexible manner, please take special care to correctly match the pins. For this, ignore the silklayer (printing) ob the PCB and look at the position of pin one, which is the one with the square pad (the others are circular). The printed outline on the PCB may work fine for jumper wires or special connectors, but with the normal ribbon cable connectors (known from old disk drives) the pin headers of either the extension board or the GB Interceptor need to be soldered onto the opposite side of the board in order for the pins to match. Therefore, keep track of pin one when creating your own solution.
